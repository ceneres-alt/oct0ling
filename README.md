Hello there 👋
I am oct0ling! 🐙

I love reverse-engineering anything, from legitimate software to malware, hardware and even Windows internals. Mainly to cheat on multiplayer games- I mean... to learn something new 😇

My coding expertise mainly focuses on offensive security and anything low-level.

My main programming languages are:

- x86 assembly
- C/C++
- A bit of C#
- Python mainly for web scraping
- Golang for API development

I also really like nintendo games. You can guess which two are my favourites 😉
